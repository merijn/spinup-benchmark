In this group of experiments we check convergency, particularly the approximation of residual based on Bernsen, 2010.
runs on 32_32_16 grid(run_1500yr_32_dt_*h):
   dt = 12 (24 hours)
runs on 64_64_16 grid(run_1500yr_64_dt_*h):
   dt =  12, possibly 24 hours
to run a model  src_*_*_*(*_*_* denotes dimensions of the model) should be copied to src_test and same for pop_in_lowres_* (* denotes dt) should be copied to pop_in_lowres, otherwise interface.py should be corrected
