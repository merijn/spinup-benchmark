In this set of experiments we will do restart from pop final state and iemic final state
1) runs 16*16*16:
   restart from pop (restart_16) with residual dt calculated on the scale of 12 hours
   restart from iemic (restart_iemic_16) with residual dt calculated on the scale of 12 hours
1) runs 32*32*16:
   restart from pop (restart_16) with residual dt calculated on the scale of 6 hours
   restart from iemic (restart_iemic_16) with residual dt calculated on the scale of 6 hours
Difference in dt for 16 and 32 runs is based on model dt time - for 16*16*16 run 12 hours is optimal, 6 is unnesessary small
